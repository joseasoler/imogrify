### Source code contributions

It is recommended to use the dev- CMake presets as they will run all required checks automatically. You will need the latest version of [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy) and [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html). Also please make sure that unit tests compile and run successfully. These conditions will also be checked by CI.
